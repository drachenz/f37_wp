# drachen's customer wordpress container image

This is mostly just for learning/testing/playing around but my end goal is to make something that works well enough to actually use.

This probably shouldn't be used by anyone except as an example for learning. There are far more advanced images out there for wordpress but, this one is mine.

Fedora 37 base, Apache, FPM. 
Configured to run rootless.
Designed to be behind a reverse SSL proxy (or run under OpenShift/kubernetes)
